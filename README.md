# Particle Simulation in JavaScript

![Preview](images/particles_preview.png)

This project is an interactive 2D particle system demonstrating emergent behavior of charged particles under simplified electrostatic-like forces. The simulation:

* Visualizes how particles attract or repel based on configurable charges.
* Supports toggling between Coulomb-like 1/rÂ² decay and linear 1/r decay.
* Implements toroidal boundary conditions (particles wrap around the edges).
* Provides a variety of tunable parameters, including force strength, inertia damping, and minimum interaction distance.

Features:

* Toroidal space: no hard edges - particles seamlessly wrap.
* Dynamic controls: adjust forces and damping live.
* Custom initialization: offset the field or randomize starting positions.
* This simulation is intended as an educational demo and a playground for experimenting with emergent patterns.
